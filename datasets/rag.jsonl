{"document": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on tasks through experience. It uses mathematical optimization techniques to identify patterns in data without being explicitly programmed for each scenario.", "question": "What is machine learning?", "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to improve performance through experience using algorithms and statistical models."}
{"document": "Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence the term 'deep') to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It has proven particularly effective in image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition tasks.", "question": "What is deep learning?", "answer": "Deep learning is a machine learning branch using multi-layered neural networks for feature extraction and is effective in image recognition, NLP, and speech tasks."}
{"document": "Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks found in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process input data and transmit signals to each other, learning patterns through a process called backpropagation.", "question": "How do neural networks work?", "answer": "Neural networks are computational models with interconnected nodes organized in layers that learn patterns through backpropagation."}
{"document": "Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Each training example consists of an input and a corresponding correct output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs and can then predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.", "question": "What is supervised learning?", "answer": "Supervised learning trains algorithms on labeled data where each input has a corresponding correct output for prediction."}
