{"id": "doc_1", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. AI has applications in machine learning, where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The field of AI encompasses various approaches including rule-based systems, expert systems, and neural networks. AI is fundamental to modern automation and intelligent systems."}
{"id": "doc_2", "content": "Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data. There are several types of machine learning: supervised learning (learning from labeled examples), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through interaction and rewards). Supervised learning is commonly used for classification and regression tasks. Unsupervised learning includes clustering and dimensionality reduction. Machine learning algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble methods."}
{"id": "doc_3", "content": "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). Deep learning can automatically learn representations needed for detection or classification from raw input data. It uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence 'deep') to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. Applications of deep learning include computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and game playing. Deep neural networks have become the dominant approach for many AI tasks in recent years."}
